# Space-Trivia-Game

###  Overview

In this assignment, I created a space trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. The game was styled with CSS. Enjoy testing your space knowledge!


###  Requirements
 You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).

* The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 

* The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.

* Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.

* Don't forget to include a countdown timer.
